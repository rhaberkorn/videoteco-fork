Video TECO is licensed under the GNU license. If you find bugs or want to 
send changes back to me, you can email me: paul@copters.com.

To build TECO on a Posix system, run ./configure and then "make". I've built it recently on Linux and Mac OS X and it compiles fine on both of those operating systems.

If you want a sample .teco_ini file, I'm putting mine at the end of this file.
It goes in your home directory.

! This file is used to initialize macros for the TECO editor!

! Q-Register 0

	This is used to set initial stuff up. As soon as the teco.ini file
	is read in, this q-register is executed.

	In this case, we use it to set the alternate rubout character to ^H
	and to set nominal paragraph format width for the MF macro to 75

	I also set backquote to work as ESCape, since the alpha keyboard
	has those two keys mapped on top of each other.
!
0/6,4EJ4,8EJ1,96EJ75UF/

! Q-Register B

	This macro moves back one buffer. It assumes there are no holes
	in the buffer space, which is a very bad assumption. However,
	performing a full 0EB on every invokation would be a bit excessive.
	A :EB loop really would be good
!

B/q*u1q*"lq*-1eb|q*u2<q2-1u2:q2ebu3q3-1"eoend'>!end!'/

! Q-Register D

	This macro takes the current indenture, and decreases it by 4.
	It assumes that the current indenture is correctly done with
	tabs and possibly one group of 4 spaces.
!

! Q-Register E

	This macro uses the current error line to position to the position
	in the source file that the error occurred on.
!

! Q-Register F

	This macro reformats the paragraph between Q1 and . such that
	lines don't exceed the nominal width. Spaces are only inserted
	between words, never within.
!

	This macro positions us to the line number specified as an argument
	to the macro.
!

G/UGJQG-1L!Macro to go to the specified line number!/

! Q-Register H

	This macro loads the symbol following the cursor into the search
	q-register.
!

H/.UHSmcQH,.X_!Macro to load next symbol into search register!/

! Q-Register I

	This macro indents the current line by 4. It assumes that the
	current indenture is correctly done with tabs and possibly one
	group of 4 spaces.

	This macro deletes from the current position to the end of the line
!

! Q-Register L

	This macro converts the following word to lower case

! Q-Register N

	This macro moves to the next sequential buffer, and assumes that
	there are no holes.
!

M/-1ebhkecmakej/

N/Q*+1EB!Go to next edit buffer!/

! Q-Register O

	This macro inserts a blank line before the one which the cursor
	is on, leaving the cursor positioned in the same place on the
	current line.
!

O/.UO0L10IQO+1J!Insert a blank line before this one!/

! Q-Register P

	This macro inserts a line in front of the current line, and
	repositions the cursor to the begining of the new line.
!

P/0L10IR!Insert a blank line before this one and move to it!/

! Q-Register R

	This macro tries to find the begining and end of a C-function,
	and load Q9 to point to the begining, Q0 to point to the end,
	and print a message in the message window with the definition
	in it (such as routine(arg1, arg2, arg3))
!

! Q-Register S

	This macro copies the search q-register into a temporary
	q-register where it can be edited. A second invokation moves
	us back to the original source buffer.
!

S/q*"lq_eb[9]_]9|[9q*u_[_]9eq9j'!Toggle in and out of the search buffer!/

! Q-Register T

	This macro prints a short table of contents in the message window.
	It's mostly useful when only a few buffers have been loaded.
